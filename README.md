The HR analytics dashboard aims to provide comprehensive insights into various HR-related metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making to improve workforce management, 
employee satisfaction, and organizational efficiency. This dashboard will be developed using two different tools: Microsoft Excel and Power BI. Additionally, SQL queries 
for all key performance indicators (KPIs) will be provided using MySQL.

Excel Dashboard:
Utilizing Excel, we've designed an intuitive dashboard with charts, tables, and conditional formatting. It offers an overview of key HR KPIs, including attrition rate, 
average hourly rate, department-wise attrition rate, and more.

Power BI Dashboard:
With Power BI, we've created an interactive and visually compelling dashboard. It features dynamic filters, slicers, and drill-down capabilities, enabling users to explore
trends and patterns in HR data with ease.

MySQL Queries (for all KPIs):
We've provided SQL queries to extract data for all KPIs. These queries can be used to fetch relevant HR metrics from your database and can be integrated into various reporting tools.
